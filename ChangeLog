	* [r601] Change API as identified on devel mailing list.
	  
	  Here is the email:
	  After some investigation into an error reported by valgrind, I'm
	  proposing an
	  API change for the MoveCopyMessages() function.
	  
	  The signature is currently
	  enum MAPISTATUS MoveCopyMessages(mapi_object_t *obj_src,
	  mapi_object_t
	  *obj_dst, mapi_id_t *message_id, bool WantCopy)
	  
	  The problem is the message_id array. The subtle part is that it
	  needs to be
	  terminated with a null mapi_id_t*, because of this:
	  for (request.count = 0; message_id[request.count];
	  request.count++);
	  
	  That is a bit error prone - enough so to be wrong in the
	  mapitest.
	  
	  Now we could just fix the mapitest and document the requirements,
	  or we could
	  change the signature.
	  
	  Two ideas for a different signature:
	  1. We could add a uint16_t count to the signature, that says how
	  long the
	  array is.
	  2. We could use a better data structure than mapi_id_t*. I'm
	  suggesting
	  mapi_id_array_t:
	  enum MAPISTATUS MoveCopyMessages(mapi_object_t *obj_src,
	  mapi_object_t *obj_dst,
	  mapi_id_array_t *message_id,
	  bool WantCopy)

2008-06-09  bradh

	* [r600] Add mapitest coverage for CopyTo operations on

	  conversion to boolean.
	  
	  Also fix compile warning about returning integer instead
	  of pointer.

	  ** WARNING **
	  
	  1. Assumption
	  ==============
	  For IDL with unknown fields followed the IDL may
	  change and the mapping of these unknown bytes incorrect.
	  It's just based on assumptions and results of the different

	  2. Broken Code
	  ==============
	  - The mapi_request / mapi_response pull function
	  - emsmdb torture tests and libmapi/emsmdb.c
	  
	  All this code is currently broken and will be fixed
	  when we start writing the new emsmdb torture suite

	* [r7] Add a dcerpc_server module in charge of the
	  exchange interfaces registration. When this module
	  is loaded prior the remote endpoint, it let us proxify
	  the exchange_nsp and exchange_emsmdb ones.
	  
	  Change the exchange_nsp ncacn_np binding string to
	  reflect how Exchange server is currently using it.
	  
	  Conform the IDL with latest pidl requirements and
	  move the MAPI_DATA structure from exchange_nsp to
	  exchange_emsmdb.

	* [r5] This commit conforms openchange with the Samba4
	  trunk and fix the autotools checks.
	  
	  I've modified the openchange torture file to
	  match the current smbtorture API and the
	  OPENCHANGE-NSPI-PROFILE test was successful.
	  
	  The NSPI ndrdump suite has fully been tested and
	  works correctly.

	* [r3] This commit fix the build system:
	  - add the -ldynconfig dependency to LDFLAGS
	  - add header checks in configure.ac. We need them
	  for the moment cause Samba4 doesn't install some headers
	  required by openchange core
	  - fix the make install
	  
	  - remove autotools generated files and definitively
	  ignore them with the .svnignore file
	  
	  - keepref keyword removed from exchange_nsp interface
	  
	  jkerihuel.

	* [r2] OpenChange public core branch released.
	  Many parts of the code are currently broken and have

	  For the moment the current code should be used
	  to build libmapi.so needed by ndrdump in KBPortal.
