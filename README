ABOUT OPENCHANGE

The OpenChange Project aims to provide a portable Open Source
implementation of Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange
protocols. Exchange is a groupware server designed to work with
Microsoft Outlook, and providing features such as a messaging server,
shared calendars, contact databases, public folders, notes and tasks. 


The OpenChange project has three goals:
* To provide a library for interoperability with Exchange protocols, and
to assist implementors to use this to create groupware that
interoperates with both Exchange and other OpenChange-based software. 

* To provide an alternative to Microsoft Exchange Server which uses
native Exchange protocols and provides exactly equivalent
functionality when viewed from Microsoft Outlook clients. 

* To develop a body of knowledge about the most popular groupware
protocols in use commercially today in order to promote development of
a documented and unencumbered standard, with all the benefits that
standards bring. 


DOCUMENTATION

There are two sources of documentation - text files in the doc/
directory, and API documentation generated from the source files using
doxygen. You can create the API documentation yourself (using "make
doxygen" at the top level) or you can refer to the copy on the
OpenChange web site at
http://apidocs.openchange.org/overview/index.html

doc/howto.txt contains instructions on how to install and set up
client libraries, client utilities and the server / proxy parts of
OpenChange.
doc/man/ contains man(1) pages for several OpenChange utilities. Note
that man pages for programming (i.e. the parts that would appear in
man3) are generated by doxygen, and will be found in apidocs/ if you
generate the documentation yourself.
doc/doxygen/ provides static content used as part of the doxygen API
documentation generation process.
doc/examples/ provides programming examples for libmapi.


STRUCTURE
[TODO: add description of each directory]
- bin/	This directory is created during the build process. It
contains the binaries (executable programs) that are compiled during
the "make" step. The source for most of these is in the utils/
directory, described below.

- doc/  This directory contains documentation - see description above
(in DOCUMENTATION) for the various contents of this directory.

- gen_ndr/

- libmapi/  This directory contains the main client-side library,
called libmapi. libmapi closely reflects the underlying protocol
operations (Exchange RPC) being performed between the client and the
server. For more information, consult the API documentation (either
build yourself, or online at
http://apidocs.openchange.org/libmapi/index.html)

- libmapi++/  This directory contains C++ bindings for libmapi. It is
not a replacement for libmapi, but is intended to provide easier
access to many libmapi functions for C++ programmers. For more
information, consult the API documentation (either build yourself, or
online at http://apidocs.openchange.org/libmapi++/index.html)

- libmapiadmin/

- libocpf/

- mapiproxy/

- pymapi/

- python/

- samba4/  This directory will be created during the build process if
you call "make samba" or execute the ./script/installsamba4.sh
script. It is used to build samba4, if required.

- setup/

- swig/

- testprogs/
