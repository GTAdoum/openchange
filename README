This is the README file for OpenChange

[TODO: add detail about what OpenChange is]

There are two sources of documentation - text files in the doc/
directory, and API documentation generated from the source files using
doxygen. You can create the API documentation yourself (using "make
doxygen" at the top level) or you can refer to the copy on the
OpenChange web site at
http://apidocs.openchange.org/overview/index.html


[TODO: add pointers to key files within doc/ directory]

[TODO: add description of each directory]
