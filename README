ABOUT OPENCHANGE

The OpenChange Project aims to provide a portable Open Source
implementation of Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange
protocols. Exchange is a groupware server designed to work with
Microsoft Outlook, and providing features such as a messaging server,
shared calendars, contact databases, public folders, notes and tasks. 


The OpenChange project has three goals:
* To provide a library for interoperability with Exchange protocols, and
to assist implementors to use this to create groupware that
interoperates with both Exchange and other OpenChange-based software. 

* To provide an alternative to Microsoft Exchange Server which uses
native Exchange protocols and provides exactly equivalent
functionality when viewed from Microsoft Outlook clients. 

* To develop a body of knowledge about the most popular groupware
protocols in use commercially today in order to promote development of
a documented and unencumbered standard, with all the benefits that
standards bring. 


DOCUMENTATION

There are two sources of documentation - text files in the doc/
directory, and API documentation generated from the source files using
doxygen. You can create the API documentation yourself (using "make
doxygen" at the top level) or you can refer to the copy on the
OpenChange web site at
http://apidocs.openchange.org/overview/index.html


[TODO: add pointers to key files within doc/ directory]

[TODO: add description of each directory]
