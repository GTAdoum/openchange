openchange-testsuite
======================

Openchange unit tests testsuite utility.
It is using check library for unit testing.

Usage
-----

Build Openchange as usual. Test suite goes to:

    bin/openchange-testsuite

To run all tests:

    bin/openchange-testsuite

By default, check runs in 'fork mode'. Which makes it hard to debug. To run in 'no-fork mode':

    CK_FORK=no bin/openchange-testsuite

To run just one testsuite or testcase, pass the name of the suite in CK_RUN_SUITE environment
variable or CK_RUN_CASE for a test case respectively:

    CK_RUN_SUITE="libmapistore named properties: interface" bin/openchange-testsuite
or
    CK_RUN_CASE="Interface" bin/openchange-testsuite

Enjoy!
