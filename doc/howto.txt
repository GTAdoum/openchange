[0x1] INTRODUCTION
####################


[0x1a] What is OpenChange?
==========================

OpenChange both provides an Open Source implementation of Microsoft
Exchange protocols under unix/linux platforms and a server able to
replace transparently Exchange in a company environment.


[0x1b] What is libmapi?
=======================

libmapi is the OpenChange MAPI implementation. It is a programming
interface designed to offer Exchange support to third party
applications.



####################
[0x2] INSTALLATION 
####################


[0x2a] Samba4 Installation
==========================

[*] First of all, install Samba 4 correctly (see howto.txt in the
    Samba4 package). This should give you the libraries, headers and
    tools you need to compile OpenChange. As a hint, as well as 
    your base compiler (apt-get install build-essential on Debian and
    Ubuntu) you will need automake and pkg-config.

# ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/samba && make
# make install && make installlib && make installheader

If you are only interested in OpenChange client libraries you don't need all of
Samba built or installed, which has several efficiencies. For example:

# export AUTOGEN_SKIP_SWAT=yes
# ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/samba --with-krb5=no && make
# make installlib && make installheader


Since the libraries will be installed in /usr/local/samba/lib, make
sure this is listed in /etc/ld.so.conf and run 'ldconfig'. On
linux, check with ldconfig -v afterwards. 

Similarly, you need to have /usr/local/samba/bin in your PATH for the
pidl binary. This is also where OpenChange installs its binaries. Eg:

$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/samba/bin

If you did a standard Samba install to the normal Samba4 location you
should not need to change PKG_CONFIG_PATH, however it does need to be
set. Use 

$ echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH

to see if it has a current value. So if PKG_CONFIG_PATH points to a valid place
and OpenChange configure still complains, you may have a problem with the Samba 
installation.)

If you have installed Samba4 somewhere else, you need to change Samba references
in ld.so.conf, and in the PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variables. 
For example, if you installed to /opt/otherplace/samba
run:

$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/otherplace/samba
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/otherplace/samba/lib/pkgconfig

pkg-config >= 0.20 is required.

[*] Install PIDL from Samba4 source directory:
# cd pidl && perl Makefile.PL && make && make install

[0x2b] Requirements
===================

OpenChange has only these dependencies in addition to Samba4's requirements:

* automake (autogen will fail with 'autogen.sh: aclocal not found')
* libmagic, to compile exchange2mbox
* flex
* libpopt

Samba4 can *use* some of the above, and will tell you in the 'configure' summary 
that some of them have not been found, however it does not *require* them.


[0x2c] OpenChange libmapi installation
======================================

If you are running out of Subversion, run autogen.sh now:

$ ./autogen.sh

Now, run configure:

$ ./configure --prefix=path_where_samba_is_installed

The default is not /usr/local/samba as you might expect, but /usr/local . So you normally
do need to specify --prefix.

You should already have made sure that the output of 'ldconfig -v' mentions
the samba library directory in the Samba installation step. If you didn't, OpenChange
will not find the libraries it needs.

You should now be able to build and install openchange MAPI library:

$ make && make install

You can test like this:

$ openchangeclient --help



#########################
[0x3] POST-INSTALLATION
#########################

The MAPI library requires a profile database and a profile in that database
before it can be used.


[0x3a] Create a profile store
=============================

$ mapiprofile --database=/tmp/profiles.ldb	\
	      --ldif=/usr/local/samba/share/setup -n


[0x3b] Create a profile
=======================

$ mapiprofile --database=/tmp/profiles.ldb	\
	      --profile=testuser-2000		\
	      --username=testuser		\
	      --password=openchange		\
	      --workstation=LOCALHOST		\
	      --domain=OPENCHANGE		\
	      -I 192.168.194.22			\
	      --create
Profile testuser-2000 completed and added to database /tmp/profiles.ldb

You need to specify:
    - the full path to the profile store database
    - the profile name you want to create
    - the username/password couple mapiprofile will use to connect to
      the Exchange server (you might want to use Administrator, on a test server)
    - your computer name. This can be any value for testing.
    - the Windows domain your Exchange server belongs to
    - the IP address of the Exchange server (this must be real. Change the example!)
    - the create operation


[0x3c] Test the profile
=======================

You can next ensure your profile was correctly created by running the
commands below:

$ mapiprofile --database=/tmp/profiles.ldb --list
We have 1 profiles in the database:
        Profile = testuser-2000

$ mapiprofile --database=/tmp/profiles.ldb --profile=testuser-2000 --dump
Profile: testuser-2000
        username       == testuser
        password       == openchange
        mailbox        == /o=First Organization/ou=First Administrative Group/cn=Recipients/cn=testuser
        workstation    == LOCALHOST
        realm          == (null)
        server         == 192.168.194.22


####################
[0x4] USING LIBMAPI
####################

[0x4a] Man Pages
================

Man pages are supplied with the MAPI library so developers can have an
overview on how to use each function properly. If you have troubles
accessing man pages, be sure your MANPATH environment variable is set
properly and point on openchange prefix installation path. (The man
pages are not installed into the /usr/local hierachy.) Eg:

$ export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/src/openchange/branches/MAILOOK/doc/man



[0x4b] Sample applications
==========================

A sample openchangeclient application is supplied so you can test the
library and have an overview on how to use it into your
applications. Please refer to the openchangeclient man page for
further information on its command line option.

$ openchangeclient --database=/tmp/profiles.ldb --profile=testuser-2000 --fetchmail



For further examples see:

$ man openchangeclient

openchangeclient is also useful in its own right as a scriptable client.

[0x4c] Web resources
====================

For an up to date material on how to use libmapi + discussions, you
are strongly encouraged to visit the OpenChange wiki:
    * http://wiki.openchange.org
    * http://wiki.openchange.org/index.php/ClientSideProgramming



########################
[0x5] OPENCHANGE SERVER
########################

If you download one of the libmapi releases, please note that the
server code is not supplied. Consider using subversion to retrieve the
latest openchange revision:

svn co https://svn.openchange.org/openchange


[0x5a] Provision
================

In order to run openchange server, you need to setup Samba4
correctly. If you have not already installed Samba4, please refer to
section 2 for further information.

Under your root account, provision the server:

# ./setup/provision --domain=OPENCHANGE --realm=OPENCHANGE.LOCAL \
		    --adminpass=secret

If you encounter problems similar to: "smbscript not found", ajust
your PATH environment variable.

If you need to add a user, run the following command from Samba4
source directory and setup arguments so it fullfill your needs:

# ./setup/newuser --username=test --unixname=test --password=test


[0x5b] Extending users Samba AD schema
======================================

In OpenChange source directory, run the following command to extend
users AD. For example to make user test and Administrator openchange
users run:

# ./setup/oc_newuser --username=test
# ./setup/oc_newuser --username=Administrator


[0x5c] Setting smb.conf
=======================

In order to run OpenChange, you need so set up additional parameters
in the [global] section of smb.conf. A sample smb.conf for OpenChange can be 
found in doc/smb.conf.example.

You need to activate the exchange dcerpc endpoints servers. The
following options overwrite the default endpoints list, we need to add
them anew:

       dcerpc endpoint servers = exchange_nsp exchange_emsmdb epmapper srvsvc wkssvc rpcecho samr netlogon lsarpc spoolss drsuapi winreg dssetup

You also need to fill information about your locale ID. 3 information
are requested:

- codepage
- input locale language
- input locale method

You can easily find the locale language and method for your country
using ./bin/locale_codepage we developed:

1. Select your Region

  $ ./bin/locale_codepage -l
Language groups:
                CP_WESTERN_EUROPE_AND_US
                CP_CENTRAL_EUROPE
                CP_BALTIC
                CP_GREEK
                CP_CYRILLIC
                CP_TURKIC
                CP_JAPANESE
                CP_KOREAN
                CP_TRADITIONAL_CHINESE
                CP_SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE
                CP_THAI
                CP_HEBREW
                CP_ARABIC
                CP_VIETNAMESE
                CP_INDIC
                CP_GEORGIAN
                CP_ARMENIAN



2. List languages in your region

  $ ./bin/locale_codepage -G CP_WESTERN_EUROPE_AND_US
	        [...]
		French_Standard
		[...]


3. Display language and method for your language

  $ ./bin/locale_codepage -i French_Standard
######### BEGIN: (copy and paste into smb.conf) #########
locale:language = 0x40c
locale:method = 0x409
######### END:   (copy and paste into smb.conf) #########

You can choose the codepage you want and check it using:

  $ ./bin/locale_codepage -c 0x4e4
        codepage                 : 0x4e4
        codepage name            : cpWindows1252
        codepage description     : ANSI - Latin I, Western European (Windows), Charset Label:Windows-1252, Aliases:ANSI_X3.4-1968, ANSI_X3.4-1986, ascii, cp367, cp819, csASCII, IBM367, ibm819, ISO_646.irv:1991, iso_8859-1, iso_8859-1:1987, ISO646-US, iso8859-1, iso-8859-1, iso-ir-100, i...

  Your OpenChange server needs a unique GUID that identifies it:

  exchange:GUID = 1b940e13-14d3-4e2a-9711-e06a2def5dfd


[0x5d] Running the Address Book Provider (EMSABP)
=================================================

The simplest is to just run "smbd", but as a developer you may find
the following more useful:

   # smbd -d3 -i -M single

that means "start smbd without messages in stdout, and running a
single process. That mode of operation makes debugging smbd with gdb
particularly easy.


########################
[0x5] SWIG BINDINGS
########################

OpenChange has introduced SWIG bindings support for its MAPI
Library. This development provides MAPI library support for different
languages.

[0x6a] Installation
===================

o Perl bindings support:
  [*] run configure with --enable-swig-perl=yes
  [*] make && make install

Note: The compilation process requires quite some time due to the code
generation for mapitags and mapicodes constant. If you intend to
develop on libmapi bindings, you should comment the following
directives in mapi.i: 

	   %include "swig_mapitags.h" 
	   %include "swig_mapicodes.h"


[0x6b] Sample applications
==========================

Tests applications are located in the tests directory of swig
languages supported.

Example: swig/perl/fetchmail.pl
